# 25+5 Clock
Welcome to the 25+5 clock timer project! This timer is a simple and easy-to-use tool that helps you stay focused and productive throughout the day. The project is built using React, Redux, and TypeScript, providing a powerful and user-friendly experience. The main purpose of 25+5 is to increase the working productivity of a person. It  remindes you to take break after certain session interal. In addition to it it provides an alarm sound informing you the interval has inded and now start your working session or take a break.

## How it works?
The 25+5 Clock Timer project allows you to set a session time and initiate a **countdown**. Once the timer reaches zero, it will start a new countdown as indicated by the *Break Length*. Upon completion of this second countdown, the timer will reset to the beginning of the *Session Length* and continue to count down. This process will repeat indefinitely, with an alarm sound playing each time the timer reaches zero. The timer is designed to provide a tool for increased focus and productivity, *looping infinitely* to ensure an ongoing experience.

## Technology Stack
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* Redux: A state management library for JavaScript applications
* TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations to enhance code reliability and maintainability
* Scss: A preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS, adding variables, nested rules, and mixins to allow for more concise and organized CSS stylesheets.
